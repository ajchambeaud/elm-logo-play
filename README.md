This project is bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).

Simple graphic experiment with elm and svg

## About
If you run the project you will see a simple animation based on the elm logo. The elm logo is going to be armed and disarmed in a loop.

You can make and add your elm based logo to the animation!

For now, this is just a proof of concept and there is a lot of work to do to make it a real application.
All the constructive comments are very welcome (just go ahead and create an issue on github).

## Make your elm based logo

Click the Edit button and start making your own logo based on the elm logo pieces.

### Move the pieces

In the edit Mode, enable the Drag mode by clicking in the "Move piece" button (is enabled by default when enter Edit mode).
Drag and Drop the pieces to create your logo.

### Rotate the pieces

In the edit Mode, enable the Rotate mode by clicking in the "Rotate piece" button. Then click a piece to select it and use the right and left arrows to rotate it.
With rotating and moving pieces you can create every elm logo based form. See this for inspiration:
